# COMP4220-exam-review
 Yeah exam review because there's too much vocab

```
python questioner.py [input filepath]
```

The questioner will print a question fill-in-the-blank style.
It will compare and reveal the answer.
In cases of multiple answers and multiword answers,
do not separate with commas.
It will mark you wrong if the order of answers is wrong because I'm lazy.
Don't worry about it.

I will add more stuff in the coming days so keep refreshing I guess.
